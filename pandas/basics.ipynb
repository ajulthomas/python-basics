    "# Pandas - Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is a Python library used for working with data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "It has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The name \"Pandas\" has a reference to both \"Panel Data\", and \"Python Data Analysis\" and was created by Wes McKinney in 2008.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Pandas ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas allows us to analyze big data and make conclusions based on statistical theories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas can clean messy data sets, and make them readable and relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relevant data is very important in data science.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Where is the Pandas Codebase?\n",
    "\n",
    "The source code for Pandas is located at this github repository https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas\n"
